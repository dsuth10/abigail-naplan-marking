# Sentence Structure Criterion (0-6 points)

**Skill focus:** The production of grammatically correct, structurally sound and meaningful sentences.

**NOTES:**
- Some students do not accurately identify their sentence boundaries with punctuation. In these cases it will be necessary to read the intended sentence. Run-on sentences should not be regarded as successful (overly repeated 'and', 'so' etc).
- Verb control and preposition errors should be considered as sentence errors.
