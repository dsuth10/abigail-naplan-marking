# Character and Setting Criterion (0-4 points)

**Skill focus:** 
- **Character:** The portrayal and development of character
- **Setting:** The development of a sense of place, time and atmosphere

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Characterisation and setting are essential components of effective narrative writing. The inclusion of the AND/OR category is necessary as different types of stories may focus on only one aspect.

- Some stories may be character-driven (e.g. Pippi Longstocking) and the setting may be very sketchy or undeveloped
- Other stories, which attempt to build atmosphere and suspense, may focus on setting the scene (e.g. the wild west genre) with little character detail
- Many stories will have a balance of these two components
