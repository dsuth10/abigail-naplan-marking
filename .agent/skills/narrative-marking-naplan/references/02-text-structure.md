---

## Score: 0
**Category:** No evidence of narrative structure
- No evidence of any structural components of a time-sequenced text
- Symbols or drawings

---

## Score: 1
**Category:** Minimal evidence of narrative structure
- Minimal evidence of narrative structure (e.g. a story beginning only or a 'middle' with no orientation)
- A recount of events with no complication
- Note: Not all recounts are factual

---

## Score: 2
**Category:** Beginning and complication present
- Contains a beginning and a complication
- Where a resolution is present, it is weak, contrived or 'tacked on' (e.g. "I woke up", "I died", "They lived happily ever after")
- May also be a complete story where all parts are weak or minimal

**Understanding Complication:**
- A complication presents a problem to be solved
- Introduces tension and requires a response
- Drives the story forward and leads to a series of events or responses
- The story has a problem to be solved but it does not add significant tension or excitement
- Complications should always be read in context

---

## Score: 3
**Category:** Complete narrative structure
- Contains orientation, complication and resolution
- Detailed longer text may resolve one complication and lead into a new complication
- May layer a new complication onto an existing one rather than conclude

**Sophisticated structures or plot devices may include:**
- Foreshadowing/flashback
- Red herring/cliffhanger
- Coda/twist
- Evaluation/reflection
- Circular/parallel plots

---
