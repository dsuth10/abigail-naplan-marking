# NAPLAN Persuasive Marking

> Systematic assessment of persuasive writing using official NAPLAN criteria.

This skill provides comprehensive analysis of persuasive texts according to the National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) marking guide. It evaluates 10 distinct criteria and produces detailed, evidence-based feedback.

## Quick Start

### Step 6: Synthesis & Overall Assessment

**Action:** Review all criterion scores and identify patterns.

   - What does the writer do well?
   - Look across all criteria for standout elements
   - Be specific, not generic

2. **Overall Weaknesses (3-5 items)**
   - What needs most improvement?
   - Focus on actionable areas
   - Prioritize high-impact improvements

3. **Total Score**
   - Sum all criterion scores
   - Maximum possible: 48 points
   - Calculate percentage if helpful

---

### Step 7: Generate Comprehensive Report

**Use the report template:** `assets/report-template.md`

**Report must include:**

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Total score (X/48)
   - Overall strengths (3-5 bullet points)
   - Areas for development (3-5 bullet points)

2. **Detailed Assessment by Criterion** (all 10 criteria)
   For each criterion:
   - Score (X/max)
   - Assessment paragraph explaining the score
   - Evidence from text (2-4 specific quotes)
   - Recommendations (2-4 actionable items)

3. **Score Summary Table**
   - All 10 criteria with scores
   - Total score

4. **Original Persuasive Text**
   - Include the full text in a code block for reference

**Formatting requirements:**
- Use clear headings and structure
- Quote actual text, don't paraphrase
- Make recommendations specific and actionable
- Ensure feedback is constructive and encouraging

**Optional:** Use `scripts/generate_report.py` to format the report programmatically if needed.

## Quality Standards

### Scoring Accuracy
- Each score must align with the category descriptor in the reference
- Justify scores with specific evidence from the text
- Be consistent across criteria (e.g., sophisticated vocabulary should align with high audience score)

### Evidence Quality
- Quote exactly from the text
- Select quotes that clearly demonstrate the point
- Include both positive examples and areas needing work

### Feedback Quality
- Be specific, not generic ("Uses sustained persuasive devices" ✅ not "Good writing" ❌)
- Be constructive and encouraging
- Focus on what the writer is doing and what to improve
- Use professional language appropriate for educational assessment

### Recommendations Quality
- Make recommendations actionable and specific
- Link recommendations to evidence
- Prioritize high-impact improvements
- Provide examples where helpful

---

## Important Notes

### Assessment Philosophy
- **Digital text only** - No OCR or handwriting interpretation required
- **First draft consideration** - Minor typos allowed at higher scores
- **Context matters** - Assess devices and structure in context
- **About a page needed** - For sustained use (persuasive devices, vocabulary, cohesion)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Don't penalize age-appropriateness** - Year 3 vs Year 9 expectations differ
2. **Don't count splice commas as correct** - They are punctuation errors
3. **Don't ignore intended sentences** - Read past poor punctuation to assess structure
4. **Don't inflate scores** - Be rigorous but fair
5. **Don't require sustained use in short texts** - About a page needed for sustained assessment

### Persuasive Text Structure
- **Introduction** - Orients reader, states position
- **Body** - Develops argument with reasons and evidence
- **Conclusion** - Reinforces position, may reflect or recommend action

### When Multiple Interpretations Exist
- Choose the interpretation most favorable to the student
- Note ambiguity in feedback
- Explain your reasoning
