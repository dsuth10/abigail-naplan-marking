# Punctuation Criterion (0-5 points)

**Skill focus:** The use of correct and appropriate punctuation to aid reading of the text.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
- In first draft writing, allowances can be made for the very occasional omission of sentence punctuation at Categories 4 and 5.
- 'Mostly' is approximately 80% but it is not intended that every use of punctuation is calculated rigorously.
- Do not penalise for different heading styles. All of these are acceptable:
  - only the first letter capitalised
  - the first letter of all major words capitalised
  - all words capitalised
  - all letters capitalised
- 'Splice' commas used to join two sentences are INCORRECT. (E.g. "The dog ate my homework, it was hungry.") Do not score this as correct sentence punctuation or comma use.
