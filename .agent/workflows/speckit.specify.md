# /speckit.specify

Use this command to create a `specifications.md` file (or update an existing one) for a new feature.

## Workflow

1.  **Understand Intent**: Clarify what the user wants to build.
2.  **Draft Specs**: Create `specifications.md` including:
    - Executive Summary
    - User Stories
    - Functional Requirements
    - Technical Constraints (referencing the Constitution)
3.  **Iterate**: Refine based on user feedback.
