# /speckit.tasks

Use this command to generate a `tasks.md` file from an approved `plan.md`.

## Workflow

1.  **Read Plan**: Parse the `plan.md` file.
2.  **Decompose**: Break down each component into step-by-step tasks.
3.  **Order**: Ensure dependencies are respected (e.g., database before API).
4.  **Output**: Write to `tasks.md` in the feature directory.
