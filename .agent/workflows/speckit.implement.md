# /speckit.implement

Use this command to begin implementing code according to `tasks.md`.

## Workflow

1.  **Check Prerereqs**: Ensure `specifications.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` exist.
2.  **Iterate**: Execute tasks one by one.
3.  **Verify**: Run tests or manual checks after each significant task.
4.  **Update**: Mark tasks as completed in `tasks.md`.
